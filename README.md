## ðŸš€ Overview

We propose a unified framework for **safety-aware control of continuum soft robots**.  
Our method leverages **High-Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs)** and **High-Order Control Lyapunov Functions (HOCLFs)**, integrated with a differentiable soft robot model, to guarantee safety while maintaining task performance.

Key features:

- âœ… **Force-aware safety constraints** during environment contact  
- âœ… **Flexible objectives**: shape regulation, end-effector tracking  
- âœ… **Differentiable SAT-based metric (DCSAT)** for conservative & efficient distance computation  
- âœ… **Simulation experiments** validating safety and performance across tasks

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Clone the repository and install the requirements:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mit-zardini-lab/contact-safe-soft-robot-control.git
cd HOCLF-HOCBF4SORO
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸ“¦ Usage

First, source the necessary environment variables:

```bash
source ./01-configure-env-vars.sh
```

## ðŸ§ª Examples

We provide several example scripts under the [`examples/`](examples/) folder
to demonstrate different control strategies and safety mechanisms for the
planar PCS soft robot:

- **`simulate_planar_pcs_contact.py`**  
  CLFâ€“CBF controller with contact-aware safety constraints. Demonstrates full
  safety-critical control with DCSAT distances and smooth contact forces.

- **`simulate_planar_pcs_NOCBF.py`**  
  Pure CLF (stabilization/tracking) without barrier constraints. Useful as a
  baseline to compare the effect of safety enforcement.

- **`simulate_planar_pcs_nocontact.py`**  
  CLFâ€“CBF controller with no force allowed. 

- **`simulate_planar_pcs_PID.py`**  
  Task-space PID controller with DCSAT-based safety barrier. A classical
  baseline combining PID tracking with modern safety metrics.

- **`simulate_planar_pcs_Potential.py`**  
  PID controller augmented with an **Artificial Potential Field (APF)** for
  obstacle avoidance, using DCSAT distances to shape repulsive forces.

Each script outputs:
- **CSV logs** (tracking error, contact/safety metrics)  
- **MP4 animations** (visualizing robot, obstacles, and contact points)  
- **Waypoint data** (forward kinematics snapshots for analysis)
