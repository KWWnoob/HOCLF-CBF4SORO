## ðŸš€ Overview

We propose a unified framework for **safety-aware control of continuum soft robots**.  
Our method leverages **High-Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs)** and **High-Order Control Lyapunov Functions (HOCLFs)**, integrated with a differentiable soft robot model, to guarantee safety while maintaining task performance.

Key features:

- âœ… **Force-aware safety constraints** during environment contact  
- âœ… **Flexible objectives**: shape regulation, end-effector tracking, manipulation  
- âœ… **Differentiable SAT-based metric (DCSAT)** for conservative & efficient distance computation  
- âœ… **Simulation experiments** validating safety and performance across tasks
